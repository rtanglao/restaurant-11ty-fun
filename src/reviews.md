# Restaurants I've visited recently

- I'm not a food critic and I pay with my own \$.
- I prefer smaller "ethnic" restaurants and I love family style dining #ymmv :-)
- For more pontifications :-) see [rolandtanglao.com](http://rolandtanglao.com/) and
  Vancouver's first :-) food blog, [vaneats.com](http://vaneats.com/) ; hosted by the fabulous
  [Dale McGladdery](https://www.group42.ca/)

1. Friday October 25, 2019 - [Dosanko, Japantown, Vancouver](http://dosankorestaurant.ca/) - loved the omu rice, the beer list and the ling cod.
   - Vegetarian Friendliness level: medium
1. Friday November 1, 2019 - [Fat Mao, Chinatown, Vancouver](http://www.fatmaonoodles.com/) - their noodle soups are great but as always loved the mapo tofu; who needs "authentic" :-) ?
   - Vegetarian Friendliness level : not sure but I'd guess low?!? My guess is that they'd accomodate you since they are super friendly.
1. Thursday November 7, 2019 - [Chinatown BBQ, Chinatown, Vancouver](https://chinatownbbq.com/) - Hong Kong (Cantonese) BBQ.
   Not as great as HK BBQ Master but it's in Chinatown and special in it's
   own way. Pork all the things :-)
   - Vegetarian Friendliness level: low (they have one or two delicious veggie side dishes but not veggie mains)
1. Monday November 11 2019 - [Ken's Kitchen, Kingsway, East Vancouver](https://kenskitchenvancouver.com/) - Honk Kong aka Cantonese food.
   Great lunch specials!Great iced Hong Kong milk tea with sweetened condensed milk!
   Great suppers ("free" chicken when your order 3 or 4 dishes, all
   translated to English unlike many places)
   - Vegetarian Friendliess level: low (lots of veggie side dishes)
1. Thursday November 14, 2019 - Haru Korean Kitchen - Kimchi stew forever (extra kimchi, no salad #ymmv )!!!!!!!
1. Saturday November 16, 2019 - Western Lake - Dimsum was great as usual! Matcha jello-like dessert was amazing.
   - Vegetarian Friendliness level: low
