# Restaurants I've visited recently

- I'm not a food critic and I pay with my own \$.
- I prefer smaller "ethnic" restaurants and I love family style dining #ymmv :-)
- For more pontifications :-) see [rolandtanglao.com](http://rolandtanglao.com/) and
  Vancouver's first :-) food blog, [vaneats.com](http://vaneats.com/) ; hosted by the fabulous
  [Dale McGladdery](https://www.group42.ca/)

1. Friday October 25, 2019 - [Dosanko, Japantown, Vancouver](http://dosankorestaurant.ca/) - loved the omu rice, the beer list and the ling cod.
   - Vegetarian Friendliness level: medium
1. Friday November 1, 2019 - [Fat Mao, Chinatown, Vancouver](http://www.fatmaonoodles.com/) - their noodle soups are great but as always loved the mapo tofu; who needs "authentic" :-) ?
   - Vegetarian Friendliness level : not sure but I'd guess low?!? My guess is that they'd accomodate you since they are super friendly.
